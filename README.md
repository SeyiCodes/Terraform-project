# Terraform Exercise

## Using Terraform to create 3 EC2 instances and put them behind an Elastic Load Balancer


- Get a .com.ng or any other domain name for yourself (be creative, this will be a domain you can keep using) and set it up with AWS Route53 within your terraform plan, then add an A record for subdomain terraform-test that points to your ELB IP address.

- Create an Ansible script that uses the host-inventory file Terraform created to install Apache, set timezone to Africa/Lagos and displays a simple HTML page that displays content to clearly identify on all 3 EC2 instances.
